                <p> JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.

            <p>We’ll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an overview of Firefox internals that needed to know about the new architecture, before moving on to the concept of Universal Binaries.</p>
            <p>We’ll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about our experience with macOS Big Sur, and discuss various updater problems we had to deal with. We’ll conclude with the release and an overview of various other improvements that are in the pipeline.</p>

                <h3>The History of JavaScript</h3>
              <p>JavaScript is everywhere, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, 
                with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself.
                Created out of necessity, it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion) of websites today, including some of the world’s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it,
                we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay.                 
                So, without further ado, let’s take a look at what JavaScript is,  how and why it was created, and what’s next for the language.</p>
              </article>

                <h3>What Is JavaScript?</h3>
              <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is one of the three core languages used to develop websites. Whereas HTML and CSS give a website structure and style,
                JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website, allowing your website’s visitors to interact with content in many imaginative ways.
                JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, meaning it runs on your computer within your browser. However, more recently the introduction of 
                Node.js has allowed JavaScript to also execute code on servers.               
                Since its release, JavaScript has surpassed Java, Flash, and other languages because it is relatively easy to learn, has a free and open community, and, 
                most importantly, is incredibly useful, allowing developers to quickly create apps with audiences in the millions.</p>
              </article>
              <article>
                <h3>JavaScript vs. Java</h3>
              <p>There’s often some confusion about the two, but JavaScript and Java (another popular programming language for data scientists after Python) 
                have almost nothing in common. The name JavaScript came from Netscape’s support of Java applets within its browser. Many say it was also a marketing 
                tactic to divert some attention from Java, which was the most buzzed-about language at the time. To run Java programs, the code must be first compiled 
                into an executable form. On the other hand, JavaScript was created to be interpreted at run time, making it much more dynamic (these days the boundary 
                of the two methods is a lot more blurred).
                JavaScript didn’t exactly get off to the best start. It didn’t perform as well, and those developing in Java considered JavaScript more of a “UI glue” 
                to be used mostly by designers and other non-engineers.</p>

                <h3>What is Front-End Development?</h3>
              <p>
                A front-end developer is someone who works on software, like desktop or mobile websites, 
                that users interact with. Specifically, a front-end developer spends time on the side of technology that the user touches and sees.

              <article>
                <h3>Internal Stakeholders</h3>
              <p>
                Firstly, a front-end developer must work with back-end engineers who manage the servers, instances, databases, and storage that
                 modern applications and sites run on.</p>
              </article>
              <article>
                <h3>Necessary Competencies</h3>
              <p>
                In order to become a front-end developer, you not only need to understand the nature of the work (which I have attempted to demystify above).
                 You also need technical skills.
                To think about it formulaically, front-end development is about engaging other stakeholders + helping users + working with technology.
